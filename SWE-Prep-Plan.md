# Senior SWE Interview Prep Plan — 6 Weeks

**Dates:** Tue Apr 14, 2026 → Sun May 24, 2026
**Target:** Start applying the week of May 25, 2026
**Weekly budget:** ~13.5 hrs (1.5 hr × 5 weekdays + 3 hr × 2 weekend days)
**Split:** ~50% DSA / ~50% System Design, with spaced-repetition review woven into every day.

---

## About this plan

**Who:** Senior SWE, 9 years total experience (7 at Microsoft on Azure Software-Defined Networking Control Plane). Targeting Senior SWE roles at top-tier tech companies, Seattle area.

**Why 50/50 DSA/SD:** SDN control plane background means system design concepts (consistency, replication, distributed coordination) are familiar in practice but need to be articulated at the whiteboard level. DSA is not a weakness but needs sharpening on specific patterns. The split reflects equal risk on both axes.

**Reference materials used in this plan:**
- **NeetCode 150** — a curated list of 150 LeetCode problems organized by pattern (arrays, two pointers, trees, graphs, DP, etc.), widely used for FAANG-level prep. See [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io).
- **DDIA** — *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann. The primary SD reading material. Covers reliability, replication, partitioning, transactions, CAP, and consensus.
- **SDI Vol 2** — *System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide: Volume 2* by Alex Xu. End-to-end design walkthroughs (distributed message queue, payment system, proximity service, metrics monitoring, etc.) structured like real interviews: requirements → estimation → API → data model → HLD → deep dive → tradeoffs. Use as mock prep reading — read the relevant chapter the day before or morning of a mock.
- **Hello Interview / Interviewing.io** — platforms for booking paid or peer SD mock interviews with real engineers. Use for Saturday mocks; self-graded solo mocks are a fallback, not a substitute.

**Companion files (all in the `SWE Interview/` folder):**
- `SWE-Prep-Plan.md` — this file
- `Mock-Practice-Notes.md` — categorized takeaways from every SD mock and practice session; review before each new mock
- `Flashcards/SWE-Flashcards.md` — full flashcard deck in markdown (source of truth)
- `Flashcards/SWE-Flashcards.html` — interactive flashcard web app (open in browser); deep-link to a specific card via `SWE-Flashcards.html#F14`
- `Flashcards/cards.js` — card data file loaded by the HTML app
- `Prep-Plan-Viewer.html` — visual HTML calendar view of this plan with LC links and card deep-links

## How to use the flashcards

**Flashcard system:** The flashcard file contains 19 decks (190 cards total). Deck 0 is the personal "flagged problems" deck (22 cards, F1–F22) — problems that caused trouble and need extra repetition. Decks 1–8 are core DSA pattern decks (Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Stack, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Trees, Tries, Backtracking). Decks 9–12 are System Design / DDIA decks (Deck 12 includes Q17–Q28 from mock learnings: WebSocket contracts, offline delivery, pre-signed uploads, PubSub fan-out, multi-device, token bucket mechanics, atomic hot-path ops, rule propagation, payment lifecycle, HSM+CDC, partition keys, timeout handling). Decks 13–18 are additional DSA decks (Linked List, Heap / Priority Queue, Graphs, 1-D DP, Intervals, Greedy). The 1-D DP deck also includes 2-D DP cards (LCS, Edit Distance) since there's no separate 2-D DP deck yet.

**Daily warm-up routine (15–30 min):**
1. Open the specified deck(s) for that day
2. Read the question — *attempt the answer in your head or scratch paper* before scrolling/flipping
3. Reveal the answer and compare honestly
4. Mark "got it" or "missed it" — missed cards come back sooner

**Timing calibration:** The 15-min warm-up assumes 2–4 specific cards called out by name (e.g., "F6+F7"). Every day after the first pass does this. A full first-pass through all 22 Deck 0 cards with no time pressure per card takes ~45 min — budget accordingly the first time you run a new full deck.

**Flagged re-solve workflow (for ⚠️ sessions, ~30 min per problem):**
1. **Flashcard first (5 min):** Pull the Deck 0 card, recall the key insight from memory before reading the answer
2. **Blank-page on LeetCode (20 min):** Solve it fresh with no hints. The goal is clean execution on the specific detail that tripped you up — not just getting AC
3. **Post-mortem (5 min):** If you got stuck again, note *exactly where* and update your flashcard hint

**Spaced repetition intervals:** +1d, +3d, +7d, +14d, +21d, +30d after first completion of a deck.

---

## Guiding principles

1. **Retrieval > re-reading.** Every session starts with a short flashcard warm-up. Re-reading DDIA without active recall is low-yield.
2. **One deep thing per day.** Weekdays have a single focused block (one LC problem OR one SD deep-dive). Don't try to do both on a weekday.
3. **Spaced repetition cadence.** Each completed topic is reviewed at Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 after first completion. Miss a day → don't try to catch up on everything, just resume.
4. **Mocks are non-negotiable.** Book real SD mocks weekly (Interviewing.io, Hello Interview, peer). Self-graded mocks count but are weaker signal.
5. **Behavioral prep is cheap.** 30 min/week on STAR stories is enough given your 9 YoE.

## Baseline snapshot (Apr 14)

From your NeetCode tree:

- **Completed (DSA ready for review-only):** Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Stack, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Trees, Tries, Backtracking, Linked List, Heap / Priority Queue, Graphs, 1-D DP
- **Not started:** Intervals, Greedy, Advanced Graphs, 2-D DP, Bit Manipulation, Math & Geometry
- **System Design:** Reading DDIA, doing walkthroughs, early mocks show gaps.

**⚠️ Flagged problems (gave you trouble — see Deck 0 in Flashcards):**

| Problem | Topic | Key insight flagged |
|---|---|---|
| Top K Frequent Elements | Arrays & Hashing | Bucket sort O(n) — not just heap |
| Encode and Decode | Arrays & Hashing | Length-prefixed chunks, not delimiter |
| Longest Consecutive Sequence | Arrays & Hashing | Hashset, only start count when n-1 absent |
| 3Sum | Two Pointers | Sort first; duplicate-skip logic |
| Trapping Rain Water | Two Pointers | leftMax/rightMax; `l < r` not `l <= r` |
| Daily Temperatures | Stack | Monotonic stack of indices; larger clears smaller |
| Largest Rectangle in Histogram | Stack | Store `(height, start_index)` in stack for width tracking |
| Koko Eating Bananas | Binary Search | Don't return early on equality; ceiling division |
| Median of Two Sorted Arrays | Binary Search | Partition j = (m+n+1)//2 - i; ±inf guards |
| Longest Repeating Char Replacement | Sliding Window | maxCount stays stale-high intentionally |
| Sliding Window Maximum | Sliding Window | Monotonic deque; pop back when smaller; pop front when out-of-window |
| Remove Nth Node from End | Linked List | n+1 gap so slow lands *before* target |
| Find the Duplicate Number | Linked List | Floyd's: start=index 0, not value 0; return entrance not meeting point |
| Merge K Sorted Lists | Heap | Heap=streaming; D&C=space; both O(N log k) |
| **Task Scheduler** | **Heap / Priority Queue** | **Math formula: `max(len(tasks), (max_count-1)*(n+1) + count_of_max)` — not just heap simulation** |
| Kth Smallest in BST | Trees | Iterative inorder: push only when node non-null, don't pre-push |
| Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree | Trees | BFS with null markers OR DFS with length prefix |
| N-Queens | Backtracking | Track cols, diag (r-c), anti_diag (r+c) |
| Course Schedule | Graphs | Kahn's: count processed==n; DFS: 3-color |
| Graph Valid Tree | Graphs | Prescreen edges==n-1 THEN check connectivity |
| Maximum Product Subarray | 1-D DP | Track curMax and curMin; update both simultaneously |
| Reorder List | Linked List | Find midpoint (slow/fast pointers) → reverse second half → merge the two halves |

Strategy:
- **Weeks 1–2:** All 12 core topics are complete — use this time to burn down flagged problem re-solves and start new DSA (Intervals, Greedy). SD focus on fundamentals (reliability/scalability/consistency) since mocks are weak.
- **Weeks 3–4:** New DSA topics (continue Greedy, 2-D DP, Advanced Graphs intro). SD focus on common designs (rate limiter, chat, Instagram, job scheduler) with Xu Vol 2 chapters as mock prep reading.
- **Weeks 5–6:** Finish long-tail DSA (Bit Manip, Math & Geometry). SD shifts to intensive mocks + weak-spot drilling. Mixed-topic LC sets simulating real interviews.

## Weekly rhythm (template)

| Day  | Time  | Block 1 (warm-up)          | Block 2 (main work)                                 |
|------|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Mon  | 1.5 h | 15 min flashcards (DSA)    | 75 min: 1 medium LC (new topic or review)           |
| Tue  | 1.5 h | 15 min flashcards (SD)     | 75 min: SD reading + write 1-pager on a concept     |
| Wed  | 1.5 h | 15 min flashcards (DSA)    | 75 min: 1 medium LC                                 |
| Thu  | 1.5 h | 15 min flashcards (SD)     | 75 min: SD problem outline (solo, timed 45 min) + review |
| Fri  | 1.5 h | 15 min flashcards (mixed)  | 75 min: Review week's LCs — re-solve without hints  |
| Sat  | 3 h   | 30 min flashcards          | 90 min SD mock (or recorded solo mock) + 60 min hard LC |
| Sun  | 3 h   | 30 min flashcards          | 90 min: 2 LC problems timed + 60 min SD review/DDIA chapter |

**Total:** ~13.5 h/week. Drop one weekday block if life happens; never drop Saturday mock.

## Spaced repetition queue (auto-scheduling rule)

When you complete a topic or a flashcard deck for the first time, add review sessions at:

- **+1 day** (quick recall)
- **+3 days** (short deck)
- **+7 days** (full deck)
- **+14 days** (full deck)
- **+21 days** (full deck)
- **+30 days** (full deck, final)

The flashcard file has decks for all 14 DSA topics (8 core + Linked List, Heap, Graphs, 1-D DP, Intervals, Greedy) and 4 System Design decks (DDIA Ch 1, Ch 2–3, Replication/Partitioning/Consistency, Common Patterns). Add new decks as you finish topics.

---

## Metrics to track (keep a running log)

- LC problems solved, by topic, by difficulty
- LC "first-try correct" rate (target > 60% on mediums in completed topics by end of Week 4)
- SD mocks done + entry in `Mock-Practice-Notes.md` for each (check themes index for recurring gaps)
- Flashcard deck completion (first pass + review count)
- DDIA chapters fully absorbed (able to explain without notes)
- STAR stories polished (target: 6 by Week 6)

## If you fall behind

Triage in this order:
1. **Keep the Saturday mock.** Always.
2. **Keep the daily 15-min flashcard warm-up.** It's the compounding asset.
3. **Drop a weekday main block over dropping review.** Review > new content.
4. **Skip weekend #2 (Sunday) before skipping #1 (Saturday).**

## Apply criteria (gate before Week 7)

Before sending applications, you should be able to:
- Solve any NeetCode 150 medium in ≤ 25 min with ≥ 60% first-pass success.
- Complete a 45-min SD mock covering requirements → estimation → API → data model → HLD → deep-dive → tradeoffs, with your peer-rated score ≥ "hire" on ≥ 2 of your last 3 mocks.
- Recite 6 STAR stories in under 2 min each, without notes.
- Explain CAP, replication lag, LSM vs B-tree (including write amplification), consistent hashing, when to reach for consensus (and its costs), load balancing strategies, and the three pillars of observability — without opening DDIA.

## Appendix: Flagged Problem Re-solve Schedule

Every problem you flagged appears at least twice in the calendar above (once in the relevant topic week, once in a later review), plus in Deck 0 of the flashcards at every warm-up. This table gives you the full queue at a glance so you can find them without scrolling.
