If fewer → must be disconnected. This rules out most invalid inputs instantly.\n\n**Why the prescreen alone is sufficient with a connectivity check:** For simple undirected graphs, n-1 edges + connected ⟺ tree. A graph with exactly n-1 edges *cannot* contain a cycle without also being disconnected (a cycle on k nodes uses k edges, leaving only n-1-k edges for the remaining n-k nodes — not enough to connect them). So the prescreen guarantees no cycles; you just need to verify connectivity.\n\n**Follow-up:** BFS/DFS from node 0, count reachable nodes. If `reachable == n`, it's a tree.

(Think: metadata services, coordination layers like etcd/ZooKeeper, not hot-path user data.)\n\n**What it gives you:** linearizable reads/writes, automatic leader election, guaranteed no split-brain. Committed entries are never lost as long as a majority survives.\n\n**What it costs:** writes require a majority round-trip (latency floor = network RTT to the slowest quorum member). Throughput limited to what a single leader can sequence. Requires an odd number of nodes (3 or 5 typical); 2 of 3 must be up for progress. Not suitable for high-throughput data planes — use it for control planes and coordination."

Expensive at scale; use sampling or log levels. **Distributed traces** (spans across services): answer 'where did this request spend its time?' — diagnose latency in multi-service call chains, find the bottleneck service.

Without it, an overwhelmed service queues unboundedly → memory exhaustion → crash → cascading failure. **Mechanisms:** return HTTP 429/503 with retry-after headers, use bounded queues that reject when full, TCP flow control, reactive streams. **Design principle:** it's better to reject work at the edge (where the caller can retry or degrade gracefully) than to accept it and fail silently deep in the stack.

At scale, subscription churn is the problem.

Good for APIs because it allows short bursts (up to bucket capacity) while enforcing a sustained rate. It is NOT traffic shaping — token bucket makes allow/deny decisions.

Push notifications: a config service pushes updates to all gateways immediately. More complex but needed for emergency throttling where delay is unacceptable. Most systems use polling as the baseline and add a push channel for urgent overrides."

A PaymentAttempt is the actual card charge against that intent — has its own processor result, status, and timestamp. Separation lets you retry failed charges without losing context.

Without HSM, server compromise exposes all encrypted card data. Auditability: application-managed audit logs can go out of sync with the main DB if a bug or partial failure skips the log write.

If you mix merchant ID into the partition key, events for the same transaction could split across partitions, breaking ordering guarantees.

If you mark it failed and retry, the customer gets double-charged. Correct approach: (1) assign an idempotency key to every payment attempt so retries are safe, (2) use optimistic locking on the payment record to prevent conflicting updates when retries and processor callbacks race to update the same record simultaneously."
